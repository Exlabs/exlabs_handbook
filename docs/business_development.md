# Business Development
Here we want to explain briefly how Busines Development works in Exlabs and how can you contribute to this process.

# I was hire for developer role, why should I care?
As a business we operate in global, highly competitive marketplace. In order to continue to thrive as a company, we must reinvent ourselves constantly and adapt to current market conditions, but primarily to customer needs. The better we are at addressing those needs, the higher is value of our company at the marketplace. Very often, you working hand to hand with a client can observe how can we better address particular need. That's why your engagement is so important in this process, as it can directly help us create better environment for you, our customers and our business. We strive to find interesting and challenging projects and the more leads we have, the more attractive pieces can be chosen from them.

Although Peter & Seb are responsible for controlling conversations with new leads and clients, the actual process of onboarding new clients starts usually far earlier and can happen across multiple touchpoints.
To be fair, for a long time this was mostly an organic process. This means mostly referrals or repetitive work from our clients. This is really great channel, above all prooving that we deliver great work and leave our customers happy, but in order to continue to grow, we decided that we have level up our game on that front.
